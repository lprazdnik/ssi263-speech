   "run_ahead" (int, 0 = off, the default; EXPERIMENTAL, opt-in): from the next bh_say, each utterance is captured
   with the unit run ahead of the chip -- a bounded streaming capture, up to RA_AHEAD segments ahead -- and played from
   the script (run_ahead.h).  Its end is inferred from bh_owed's ^F echo accounting and a quiet interval: a policy,
   not a proof.  bh_busy follows run_ahead.h's completion: busy until the capture has ended by that policy, every
   write has played and the speech has ended (a pause the final load, ended: the chip's request alone is not
   silence); a limit hands over to the lockstep's own judgement (a spoken final load held: its UNANSWERED_S counts
   from that load's request); an allocation failure is -1.  Input given meanwhile is held (bh_say).  The capture's other effects -- the unit's serial bytes,
   ^F echoes, XON/XOFF, its RAM -- happen at the capture's frontier, ahead of the listener: a cancel cannot take them
   back (nvda/tools/run_ahead_state.py compares them).  bh_cancel over a running capture first lets the unit, parked
   mid-routine at the frontier, run on to a wait for an interrupt (run_ahead.h ra_settle), and holds its A/R not
   requesting over the first ^X slice: before that, cancelled text could lead the next utterance
   (nvda/tools/run_ahead_cancel.py).  Timing is emulated Z180 time, not a chip-bus measurement.
   The pipe host has no such mode.  Read-only: "run_ahead_state" (RA_*), "run_ahead_end" (RA_END_*),
   "run_ahead_played" / "run_ahead_captured" (writes), "run_ahead_settled" / "run_ahead_dropped" (the last cancel's
   ra_settle), "run_ahead_held" (the last utterance ended at its bound, a spoken final load held), "held" (inputs
   waiting), "port_a0", "model" (bl_model: BL_MODEL_*), "fault" (BH_FAULT_*: 1 the run-ahead script, 2 a board
   event).  Read and reset by the caller: "tx_lost", "writes_lost" (bytes of bh_tx, writes of bh_writes the host could not keep: records, not a fault).
   "cancel_settle" (3 = both bits, the release default; 0 restores the old race for tests):
   the lockstep's bh_cancel lets the unit run on, A/R not requesting and its chip writes dropped, to a wait for an
   interrupt before its ^X (bit 0), and holds A/R not requesting over the first ^X slice (bit 1); read-only
   "cancel_settled" (1 idle, 0 the cap, -1 not run) and "cancel_dropped" (its writes) for the last cancel.
   "flash_timed" (write only; 0 = off, the default): the file flash's busy time (bl_board.h bl_flash_timed), which the
   emulator turns on; read-only "flash_busy" and "flash_chip_erases" (bl_flash_busy).
   Tests only: "run_ahead_break" (RA_BRK_*), "log_ar" (the A/R edges given to the unit, reg 8, and the run-ahead
   segments' openings, reg 9 + how, in the write log), and one failure each, as memory running out would cause it:
   "fail_alloc_size" (run_ahead.c's next allocation of that many bytes), "fail_event" / "fail_tx" / "fail_log" (the
   n-th board event, transmitted byte, logged write from now). */
